# Out of Box - Development Action Plan

## Overview

This action plan breaks down the Out of Box development into progressive phases with parallel work streams. Tasks are organized by priority and dependencies, allowing multiple team members to work simultaneously while ensuring critical path completion.

## üçé First-Time iOS Developer Guide

> **Important**: This project is designed for first-time iOS developers. Every step should result in **visible changes in the iOS Simulator** so you can see immediate progress and learn how iOS development works.

### Prerequisites Setup

#### Mac Environment Requirements
- [ ] **Install Xcode 15.0+** from Mac App Store
- [ ] **Verify iOS Simulator** works (test with any template app)
- [ ] **Apple Developer Account** (free for development, $99/year for App Store)
- [ ] **Git** installed (comes with Xcode)
- [ ] **Basic understanding** of Swift syntax (recommend Swift Playgrounds first)

#### Immediate Verification Steps
```bash
# Verify Xcode installation
xcode-select --print-path

# Test simulator launch
open -a Simulator

# Verify git
git --version
```

### üéØ "See Progress Immediately" Philosophy

**Every single task in this plan is designed to show visible results in the iOS Simulator within 30-60 minutes of work.**

#### Example Progress Checkpoints:
1. **Create Project** ‚Üí See "Hello World" in simulator
2. **Add Button** ‚Üí See button that responds to taps
3. **Add Navigation** ‚Üí See screen transitions
4. **Add Data Model** ‚Üí See real data displayed
5. **Add Photo Capture** ‚Üí See camera working in simulator
6. **Add Notifications** ‚Üí See push notifications appear

#### Learning-First Approach:
- Start each task by running existing code in simulator
- Make ONE small change at a time
- Run simulator after each change
- Understand what each line of code does
- Never copy-paste large blocks without understanding

### üèóÔ∏è "Baby Steps" Development Strategy

#### Instead of: "Build the entire challenge system"
#### Do: Progressive mini-milestones

**Example: Challenge Display Feature**
1. Show hardcoded text "Today's Challenge" ‚Üí Run simulator
2. Show hardcoded challenge title ‚Üí Run simulator  
3. Show hardcoded challenge description ‚Üí Run simulator
4. Make text beautiful with colors/fonts ‚Üí Run simulator
5. Add a "Complete" button ‚Üí Run simulator
6. Make button respond to taps ‚Üí Run simulator
7. Connect to real data model ‚Üí Run simulator
8. Add animations and polish ‚Üí Run simulator

#### Learning Outcome: 
By step 8, you understand SwiftUI, data binding, user interaction, and animations - not just copied code.

### üì± Simulator-First Development Rules

#### Always Test In Simulator:
- **iPhone 15 Pro** (main target)
- **iPhone SE** (small screen testing)
- **iPad Pro** (large screen testing)
- **Different iOS versions** (17.0+)

#### Visual Progress Validation:
- [ ] Can you navigate through the app?
- [ ] Do buttons respond immediately?
- [ ] Are animations smooth?
- [ ] Does text scale properly?
- [ ] Do images load correctly?

#### Common First-Timer Gotchas:
- **Build errors**: Always read error messages carefully
- **Simulator crashes**: Force-quit and restart simulator
- **Code not updating**: Clean build folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
- **UI not showing**: Check preview vs simulator differences
- **Data not persisting**: Understand iOS app sandbox

### üéì Learning Checkpoints by Phase

#### After Foundation Setup (Week 1-2):
**You Should Know:**
- How to create and run iOS projects
- Basic SwiftUI view creation
- How to use iOS Simulator effectively
- Git basics for iOS projects

- Notification permissions and scheduling
- Camera/photo permissions and capture
- Basic iOS app lifecycle

**Simulator Should Show:**
- Complete user onboarding flow
- Daily challenge display and interaction
- Photo capture and display
- Notification scheduling (test on device)
- Settings screens that actually work

#### After Each Feature:
**Test These User Flows:**
1. Fresh install ‚Üí Onboarding ‚Üí First challenge
2. Complete challenge ‚Üí Take photo ‚Üí View history
3. Skip challenge ‚Üí Next day simulation
4. Change settings ‚Üí See immediate effects
5. Offline mode ‚Üí Data still accessible
